<h2>A delicious Asian-inspired salmon dish grilled on a cedar plank</h2>
<p>This dish will make your mouth water and your taste buds tingle!  A simple soy-based marinade adds incredible flavor while being quick enough to make on a weeknight while your children scream obscenities at you.  The cedar plank offers some smokiness without imparting the taste of a California wildfire.  Perfect paired with an over-priced Napa Valley Chardonnay.  Yum!</p>
