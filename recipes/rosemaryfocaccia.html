<h2>The best bread on Earth</h2>
<p>Focaccia bread is super duper good!  If it didn't make you fat, I would eat a whole pan of it every single day.  The secret to great focaccia is to drown the bread in copious amounts of olive oil prior to baking it.  You can thank me later.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/3 cup warm water</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sugar or honey</li>
    <li>1 (0.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>3 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons flaky sea salt, plus more for sprinkling</li>
    <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Proof the yeast. In the warm water and sugar. (I highly recommend using a thermometer to measure the temperature of the water, so that it is not too hot or too cold.)</li>
    <li>Knead the dough. Gradually add in the flour, olive oil and salt. Then knead for 5 minutes using the dough attachment or a stand mixer, or knead the dough by hand.</li>
    <li>First dough rise. Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased mixing bowl, and cover with a damp towel. Let the dough rest in a warm location for 45-60 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Second dough rise.  Shape the dough into a large circle or rectangle until that the dough is about 1/2-inch thick. Cover and let the dough continue to rise for another 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Prepare the dough. Heat oven to 400°F. Transfer the dough to a large parchment-covered baking sheet (or press it into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish). Use your fingers to poke deep dents — like seriously, poke all the way down until you touch the baking sheet — all over the surface of the dough. Then drizzle a tablespoon or two of olive oil evenly all over the top of the dough, and sprinkle evenly with the fresh rosemary needles and sea salt.</li>
    <li>Bake. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the dough is slightly golden and cooked through.</li>
    <li>Serve. Remove from the oven, and drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired. Slice, and serve warm.</li>
